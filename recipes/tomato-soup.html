    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This tomato soup is… honestly everything right now! 
        It’s made with 5 ingredients – modeled after the iconic Marcella Hazan tomato sauce recipe! 
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ll never say no to a bowl of tomato soup with a hot and crusty, buttery, salty piece of garlic bread, 
        or a grilled cheese, and this one is so simple that there is no good reason you shouldn’t make it for dinner immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, peel removed, cut into 4 chunks</li>
        <li>1 stick of salted butter</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves smashed garlic</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the tomatoes, butter, and onion in a large saucepan or Dutch oven. Bring it up to a low bubble, then turn the heat to medium low. Cover partially with a lid; let it simmer for 45 minutes. Stir every 15 minutes or so to prevent scorching on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Remove the onion pieces using tongs. I leave the garlic in there, but that’s up to you!</li>
        <li> Using an immersion blender, blend up the soup until it’s a smooth as you want it. Taste and adjust; you can thin it out with milk, water, broth, cream, whatever you want; I just leave it as-is!</li>
    </ol>
